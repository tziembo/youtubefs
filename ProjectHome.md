YoutubeFS enables you to browse your favorite Youtube videos locally on your desktop
without going to the youtube website. Just create a youtube account and add videos to your
playlists, favorites list or subscribe to different channels. YoutubeFS then enables you to
automatically load these videos to a local folder on your desktop. You can then view these videos (using a browser) as if they are local files.

Currently YoutubeFS works on Linux (Ubuntu 7.10) and Mac OS (Leopard 10.5.1). Please refer to the quick start guide for more details.

Also check out [YouSeek](http://youseek.akruty.com) an iPhone app based on the YoutubeFS API.
